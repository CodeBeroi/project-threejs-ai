## <a name="context"> 💡 Context & acknowledgement 

This project was *created based on a video by JSMastery*. I encourage you to check their content if you want to recreate this project step by step and learn about threejs and how to easily use image generating AI within your React app !

<a  href="https://youtu.be/ZqEa8fTxypQ?feature=shared"  target="_blank"><img  src="https://github.com/sujatagunale/EasyRead/assets/151519281/1736fca5-a031-4854-8c09-bc110e3bc16d"  /></a>

You can also find their original repository [here](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_threejs_ai) although some updates (mainly on OpenAI) make some content inaccurate now. I fixed thoses issues while building my own project ; should you encounter any problem with original repo, make sure to check if the fix is available within my version.
